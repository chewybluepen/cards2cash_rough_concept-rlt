Replit App Creation Prompt – Cards2Cash
Overview & Purpose
Develop a mobile app using Next.js and TypeScript called Cards2Cash that empowers users—especially those without access to traditional banking—to convert prepaid phone credit (from carriers like Digicel, GTT, etc.) into digital funds. Users can generate virtual cards for online shopping and perform international transactions with real-time currency conversion. The solution must be secure, intuitive, and provide an end-to-end demonstration—from user registration and prepaid code loading to virtual card generation, transaction management, and robust error handling.
